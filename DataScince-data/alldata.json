We harness innovative technology and knowledge to simplify everyday life for our customers, optimize operations for our restaurants and local shops, and provide our riders with reliable earning opportunities daily. Here at talabat, we are building a high performance culture through engaged workforce and growing talent density. We're all about keeping it real and making a difference. Our 6,000+ strong talabaty are on an awesome mission to spread positive vibes. We are proud to be a multi great place to work award winner.\nA little bit about our engineering culture\nWe love finding new ways to shorten the feedback loops, create together and make an impact. To do so, our engineering culture and practices are based on eXtreme Programming (XP), Domain-Driven Design, Lean and Continuous Delivery.

    "company": "Luxoft",
    "location": "Cairo",
    "description": "Project description\nLuxoft is one of the major software services companies world-wide. In particular, we develop high quality software in automotive industry for most famous car makers. The software inside a vehicle was traditionally expected to be a very controlled and self-contained environment. Equipping cars with perception and machine intelligence changes a lot in the overall picture of the vehicle manufacturer. Luxoft's goal is to empower our customers, with deep domain knowledge and smart solutions, to develop cars of the future. The project is dedicated to the development of the tools for virtual testing of ADAS systems using data-driven development approach. Tools will allow testing and validation of higher automation level cars.

    "location": "Cairo",
    "description": "What You'll Do\nIt used to be that high-speed packet forwarding was performed in dedicated ASIC designs. These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a Senior ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.\nAs part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.\nWho You'll Work With\nYou will work with Cisco's best-in-class switching solution team. Our team is responsible for driving integration of the Nexus systems and ACI with software, including OpenStack, Docker, and Open vSwitch, to help our customers build multi tenant clouds.\nWho You Are\nYou are a talented, motivated ASIC verification engineer to join the team and contribute to the verification of very complex ASICs. You will have in-depth knowledge of ASIC Design Verification, hands-on experience in System Verilog/SVA and UVM methodology, with in-knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.\nYou'll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.\nYou will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.\nResponsibilities Include:\nDevelop block-level test benches, including components such as drivers, monitors, and sequences.\nMaintain existing test benches for both block-level and cluster-level verification.\nUpgrade test benches to incorporate new features.\nPerform end-to-end verification of various design blocks.\nCreate test plans and define cover points.\nUpdate and enhance configuration and reset sequences (APIs).\nCollaborate with designers and verification engineers to conduct cross-block verification.\nWrite tests and debug regression issues.\nContribute to top-level verification efforts.\nParticipate in emulation testing activities.\nMinimum requirements:\nMaster's degree in EE (Electrical & Electronics) or CE (Computer Engineering) with 2+ YoE in Design Verification\nOr\nBachelor's degree in EE or CE and 3+ YoE in Design Verification\nProficiency in digital design.\nHands-on and deep understanding of Verilog and System Verilog.\nFamiliarity and comfort with UVM methodology.\nBasic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming).\nPreferred Qualifications:\nCapability to debug issues independently.\nknowledge of programming languages (C/C++).\nFamiliarity with Perforce/Git.\nExperience with Formal Verification.\nExperience with Emulation.\nOther Skills:\nSelf learning, Problem Solving and logical thinking skills.\nGood written and verbal communication skills.\nCollaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and grow.\nWe Are Cisco\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're \u201cold\u201d (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!\nBut \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\nMessage to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:\nWhen available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\nU.S. employees have to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.\nEmployees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco's flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco's Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:\n.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;\n1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;\n1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.\nFor non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.\nCisco Systems",
